## Here are some of the basics of the game:
- The player can hook up their Oculus VR Headset to their computer and start the game. 
- The player can choose from a menu to play through a tutorial or play a singleplayer match against an AI
- The player can navigate in their wheelchair with different gestures to perform different actions like braking, turning, moving forwards/backwards
- The players will knock around the ball to get the ball in the net to score points. 
- The player will need to be conscious of the fact that they are not allowed to stand
- The player may fall depending on their actions, so they must keep in mind tipping over due to physics is a possibility.
