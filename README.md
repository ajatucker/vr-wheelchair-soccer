## Here are some of the basics of the game:
- The player can hook up their Oculus VR Headset to their computer and start the game. 
- The player can choose from a menu to play through a tutorial or play a singleplayer match against an AI
- The player can navigate in their wheelchair with different gestures to perform different actions like braking, turning, moving forwards/backwards
- The players will knock around the ball to get the ball in the net to score points. 
- The player will need to be conscious of the fact that they are not allowed to stand
- The player may fall depending on their actions, so they must keep in mind tipping over due to physics is a possibility.

## Technologies Used
- Unreal Engine 4: We used Unreal Engine 4 to design and build the game, leveraging its powerful graphics and physics engine to create a realistic and immersive experience. We utilized both Unreal Engine's Blueprints visual scripting system and C++ code to implement the game's features and mechanics.
- Oculus Quest 2: The game was designed and tested using the Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset.

## Future Plans
- Multiplayer: In addition to the single player mode, we plan to add support for multiplayer matches against other players online.
- Updated user interface: We will continue to refine and improve the user interface to make it even more intuitive and user-friendly.
- Additional maps and gamemodes: We plan to expand the game with new maps and gameplay modes to keep things fresh and exciting.
